- A vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the web server to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker's choosing.
- There are two types of SSRF
	- **Regular** where the data is returned to the attacker's screen.
	- **Blind** where no data is returned to the attacker's screen.
- ## *Impact*
	- Access to unauthorized areas.
	- Access to customer/organisational data.
	- Ability to Scale to internal networks.
	- Reveal authentication tokens/credentials.
- Potential SSRF vulnerabilities can be spotted in web applications in many different ways.
	- **When a full URL is used in a parameter in the address bar**
	- **A hidden field in a form**
	- **A partial URL such as just the hostname**
	- **path of the URL**
- If working with a blind SSRF where no output is reflected back to you, you'll need to use an external HTTP logging tool to monitor requests such as `requestbin.com`, your own HTTP server or Burp Suite's Collaborator client.
- ## *Bypassing Common Defenses*
	- Developers aware of the risks of SSRF vulnerabilities may implement checks in their applications to make sure the requested resource meets specific rules.
	- There are usually two approaches to this, either a deny list or an allow list.
	- #### *Deny List*
		- All requests are accepted apart from resources specified in a list or matching a particular pattern.
		- A Web Application may employ a deny list to protect sensitive endpoints, IP addresses or domains from being accessed by the public while still allowing access to other locations.
		- A specific endpoint to restrict access is the localhost, which may contain server performance data or further sensitive information, so domain names such as localhost and 127.0.0.1 would appear on a deny list.
		- Attackers can bypass a Deny List by using alternative localhost references such as `0`, `0.0.0.0`, `0000`, `127.1`, `127.*.*.*`, `2130706433`, `017700000001` or subdomains that have a DNS record which resolves to the IP Address `127.0.0.1` such as `127.0.0.1.nip.io`.
		- In a cloud environment, it would be beneficial to block access to the IP address `169.254.169.254`, which contains metadata for the deployed cloud server, including possibly sensitive information. An attacker can bypass this by registering a subdomain on their own domain with a DNS record that points to the IP Address `169.254.169.254`.
	- #### *Allow List*
		- All requests get denied unless they appear on a list or match a particular pattern, such as a rule that an URL used in a parameter must begin withÂ `https://website.thm`.
		- An attacker could quickly circumvent this rule by creating a subdomain on an attacker's domain name, such as `https://website.thm.attackers-domain.thm`.
		- The application logic would now allow this input and let an attacker control the internal HTTP request.
	- #### *Open Redirect*
		- An endpoint on the server where the website visitor gets automatically redirected to another website address.
		- For example, the link `https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com`. This endpoint was created to record the number of times visitors have clicked on this link for advertising/marketing purposes.
		- But imagine there was a potential SSRF vulnerability with stringent rules which only allowed URLs beginning with `https://website.thm/`. An attacker could utilize the above feature to redirect the internal HTTP request to a domain of the attacker's choice.
