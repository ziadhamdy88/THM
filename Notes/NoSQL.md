- A NoSQL database refers to a non-relational database.
- Used nowadays for big Data and IoT devices due to their powerful features such as fast queries, ease of use to developers, scale easily, and flexible data structure.
- **Types:** MongoDB, Couchbase, RavenDB, etc..
- ## Components
	- **Collections:** Similar to tables or views in MySQL and MSSQL.
	- **Documents:** Similar to rows or records in MySQL and MSSQL.
	- **Fields:** Similar to columns in MySQL and MSSQL.
	- **Documents** are in MongoDB are objects stored in a format called `BSON`, which supports `JSON` data types for document storing.
 - ## Operators
	 - `$and` -> `AND`
	 - `$or` -> `OR`
	 - `$eq` -> `=`
	 - `$ne` -> `!=`
	 - `$gt` -> `>`
	 - `$lt` -> `<`
	 - `$where` matches records based on JavaScript condition
	 - `$exists` matches records that have a certain field
	 - `$regex` matches records that satisfy certain regular expression
- Connect to MongoDB using `mongo`.
- Use `show databases` to list the available databases.
- Connect/Create a database using `use <dbname>`.
- Create collections using `db.createCollection("<collection_name>")` function.
- Show collections using `db.getCollectionNames()` function.
- Create a document within a collection called `users` using `db.users.insert({id:"1", username:"admin", email:"admin@admin.com", password:"password123"})`.
- List documents within a collection using `db.users.find()`.
- Update a document with `id=2` using `db.users.update({id:"2"}, {$set: {username:"tryhackme"}})`.
- Remove a document using `db.users.remove({'id':'2'})`.
- Drop a collection using `db.users.drop()`.
- ## NoSQL Injection
	- #### Bypassing login pages
		- Usually, web applications use `db.users.find({query})` or `db.users.findOne(query)` functions where the `query` is `JSON` data that's sent via the application `{"username":"admin", "password":"password123"}`.
		- When correct credentials are provided, a document is returned, while a `null` reply is received when providing the wrong credentials or when nothing matches.
		- `db.users.findOne({username:"admin", password: {"$ne":"xyz"}})`
			- This is searching for a user with the username `admin` and his password not equals to `xyz` which is almost always true.
		- Login in as a user that is not `admin` using `db.users.findOne({username:{"$ne":"admin"}, password:{"$ne":"xyz"}})`.
		- Using Burp Suite to capture the login request and change the passed parameters to. ![](nosql-bypass-login.png)
	- #### Exploiting NoSQL Injection
		- Find an entry point that doesn't sanitize the user input correctly.
		- Understand how the web application passes the request to the database. Sometimes the web apps accept the user's input via `GET` or `POST` queries, and sometimes they accept a `JSON` object, as is the case with APIs.
		- **For GET and POST queries**
			- Injecting an array of the MongoDB operator to match the `JSON` object to match the `key:value`. `http://example.com/search?username=admin&role[$ne]=user`
			- `http://example.com/search?username=[$ne]=ben&role=user` gets all the users with role user.
