- ## Injection
	- Exploited when user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application.
	- **Types:**
		- *SQL Injection (SQLi):*
			- Input passed to SQL queries.
		- Command Injection:
			- Input passed to system commands.
			- When server-side code like PHP in a web application makes a system call on the hosting machine.
			- Attacker could execute operating system commands on the server.
			- Open a reverse shell to become the user that the web server is running as.
			- For example `;nc -e /bin/bash`.
			- *Blind Command Injection:*
				- When the system command to the server doesn't return the response to the user in the HTML document.
			- *Active Command Injection:*
				- Return the response to the user.
	- **Remediation:**
		- Use an allow list where the user input is compared to a list of safe input characters, if not safe then it is rejected and the application throws an error.
		- Stripping input where the dangerous characters are removed before the input is processed.
- ## Broken Authentication
	- Allow access to other users' accounts which would allow the attacker to access sensitive data.
	- **Types:**
		- Brute-force attacks.
		- Use of weak credentials.
		- Weak session cookies.
	- **Mitigation:**
		- Enforce strong password policies.
		- Enforce automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts.
		- Implement Multi Factor Authentication.
	- **Example:**
		- User input without sanitization, a user named "admin" exists on an application.
		- We want to access that account, a possible exploit would be to re-register that username but with a slight modification.
		- Use the username ` admin` (space at the beginning), fill any required inputs and submit.
		- The new user if created will have the same right as the normal admin.
		- The new user will also be able to see all the content presented under the user `admin`.
- ## Sensitive Data Exposure
	- When a web application divulges sensitive data.
	- Often involves techniques such as Man in The Middle (MITM)
- ## XML External Entity 
- ## Broken Access Control
- ## Security Misconfiguration
- ## Cross-site Scripting
- ## Insecure Deserialization
- ## Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- ## Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
