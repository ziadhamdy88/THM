# Passive Reconnaissance
- Gathering of information about the target without directly communicating with it.
- `whois <domain-name>`
- Nslookup:
	- `nslookup -type=A <domain-name>` DNS A records.
	- `nslookup -type=MX <domain-name> @<dns-server>` Mail exchange records at a certain DNS server.
	- `nslookup -type=TXT <domain-name>` DNS TXT records.
- `dig <domain-name> A` 
- `dig <domain-name> @<dns-server> TXT`
- DNSDumpster
- Shodan.io
# Active Reconnaissance
- Gathering information by have some sort of contact with the target, a phone call, visiting the target, checking the website, or checking if their firewall has an SSH port open.
- ## Web Browser
	- Developer tools.
	- FoxyProxy.
	- User-Agent Switcher and Manager gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different browser. You can pretend to be using a mobile browser when you're using a PC browser.
	- Wappalyzer provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites.
- `ping -c <number-of-packets> <ip/hostname>`
- `traceroute <ip/hostname>`
	- Modify the TTL in the IP header to reveal only certain amounts of routers' IP.
- ## Telnet
	- Teletype Network protocol was developed to communicate with a remote server via CLI.
	- Default port is 23.
	- Telnet sends all data, including usernames and passwords in clear text.
	- Telnet client relies on the TCP protocol, Telnet can be used to connect to any service and grab its banner.
	- `telnet <ip> <port>`.
	- Can connect to any service that uses TCP and exchange a few messages unless it uses encryption.
	- Example:
		`telnet <ip> <port>`
		`GET / HTTP/1.1`
- ## Netcat
	- Can function as a client that connects to a listening port, and can act as a server that listens on ports.
	- Supports both TCP and UDP protocols.
	- Connect to a server using `nc <ip> <port>`, similar to `telnet <ip> <port>`.
	- On the server side `nc -lvnp <port>`
		- `-l` listen mode
		- `-v` verbose output
		- `-n` numeric only, no resolution of hostnames via DNS
		- `-p` specify the port
	- On the client side `nc <ip> <port>`.
