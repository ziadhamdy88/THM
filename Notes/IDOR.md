- Insecure Direct Object Reference is a type of access control vulnerability.
- This type of vulnerability can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), too much trust has been placed on the input data, and it is not validated on the server-side to confirm the requested object belongs to the user requesting it.
- ## *Encoded IDs*
	- When passing data from page to page either by post data, query strings, or cookies, web developers will often first take the raw data and encode it.
	- Encoding ensures that the receiving web server will be able to understand the contents.
	- Encoding changes binary data into an ASCII string commonly using the `a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and =` character for padding.
- ## *Hashed IDs*
	- Hashed IDs are a little bit more complicated to deal with than encoded ones, but they may follow a predictable pattern, such as being the hashed version of the integer value.
	- Using [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) to get the clear text ID.
- ## *Unpredictable IDs*
	- If the Id cannot be detected, an excellent method of IDOR detection is to create two accounts and swap the Id numbers between them.
	- If we can view the other users' content using their Id number while still being logged in with a different account (or not logged in at all), we've found a valid IDOR vulnerability.
- The vulnerable endpoint we're targeting may not always be something we see in the address bar. It could be content our browser loads in via an AJAX request or something that we find referenced in a JavaScript file.
- Sometimes endpoints could have an unreferenced parameter that may have been of some use during development and got pushed to production.
- For example, we may notice a call to `/user/details` displaying our user information (authenticated through our session). But through an attack known as parameter mining, we discover a parameter called `user_id` that we can use to display other users' information, for example, `/user/details?user_id=123`.
